# Writing interpreter in go
This is for people who love to look under the hood to see how things are made!. For people that love love to learn by understanding how somthing really works.

In this project, we're going to write our own interpreter for our own programming language (from scratch). No 3rd party tools or libraries are going to be used!

Notes: The aim of the project is to learn, not going to have the performance of a fully-fledged interpreter, nor the best features.

## Tree-Walking interpreter
An interpreter that parse the source code, build an abstract syntx tree (AST) out of it and then evaluate the tree.

we're going to build our own lexer, parser, tree representation and evaluator.

## The programming language
every interpreter is built to interpret a specific programming language. Without a compiler or an interpreter a programming language is nothing more than an idea or a specification.

The language we're going to build is going to be called : Monkey!
The features of The Monkey Programming Language:
- C-like syntax
- variable bindings
- integers and booleans
- arithmetic expressions
- built-in functions
- frst-class and higher-order functions
- closures
- data sturctures : [strings, arrays, hash data]

## Roadmap
The interpreter we’re going to build in this book will implement all these features. It will
tokenize and parse Monkey source code in a REPL, building up an internal representation of
the code called abstract syntax tree and then evaluate this tree. It will have a few major parts:
- the lexer
- the parser
- the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)
- the internal object system
- the evaluator
### Lexer 
### Parser 
#### Parsing let statements

Expressions produce values, statements don’t. `let x = 5` doesn’t produce a value,
whereas 5 does (the value it produces is 5). A return 5; statement doesn’t produce a value,
but add(5, 5) does. This distinction - expressions produce values, statements don’t - changes
depending on who you ask, but it’s good enough for our needs

Here's a fully valid let example:

```javascript
    let x = 10;
    let y = 15;
    let add = fn(a, b) {
    return a + b;
    };
```

```let <identifier> = <expression>;```
